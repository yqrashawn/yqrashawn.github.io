This post are descriptions and tutorial of my [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/blob/master/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json][personal KE complex modification]].

I [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/pull/162][merged]] my personal [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements][Karabiner Elements]] configuration into the [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications][official repo]]
several days ago. You can import my personal rules [[https://pqrs-org.github.io/KE-complex_modifications/][here]]. To achieve efficiency,
I use karabiner with [[https://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]] mainly through [[https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/external/][alfred workflow external trigger]] and
[[https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/osascript.1.html][osascript]] (command line tool for calling AppleScript code).

Here is these configurations. Please note that I update my configurations
everyday. So I  can't keep this post up to date. The key here is to introduce a
system for launching apps, invoking scripts and all stuffs that can be done with
shell (everything). When you can get anything you want with few key strokes, *it
feels great*.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qepdfdu0djyed7v/workflows.zip?dl=0][Download all my workflow from dropbox]], please contact [[https://github.com/yqrashawn][me]] when this link broken. I
may update this post for each specific config if I have time in the future (may
not happen). If you have any problems or ideas, please [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/issues/new][open an issue]] in my
dotfile repo. And you can also check [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications][Ke-complex_modifications]] official repo for
more rules and discussion.
