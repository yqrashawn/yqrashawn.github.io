UPDATE 2018-09-19 Wed

My config in [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications][KE-complex-modifications]] is outdated. I'm now using [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo][GokuRakuJoudo]]
to config karabiner. It enables user to write the configuration in a much more
compact karabiner.edn file, you can check out [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/blob/master/.config/karabiner.edn][mine]].  I'll write a post about it
soon. If your karabiner.json is bloated, you may want to try it. Recommend to
check the [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/blob/master/Tutorial.org][tutorial]] first.

ORIGINAL

This post are descriptions and tutorial of my [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/blob/master/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json][personal KE complex modification]].

I [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/pull/162][merged]] my personal [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements][Karabiner Elements]] configuration into the [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications][official repo]]
several days ago. You can import my personal rules [[https://pqrs-org.github.io/KE-complex_modifications/][here]]. To achieve efficiency,
I use karabiner with [[https://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]] mainly through [[https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/external/][alfred workflow external trigger]] and
[[https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/osascript.1.html][osascript]] (command line tool for calling AppleScript code).
Here are these configurations. Please note that I update my configurations every
day. So I  can't keep this post up to date. The key here is to introduce a
system for launching apps, invoking scripts and all stuffs that can be done with
shell (everything). When you can get anything you want with few key strokes, *it
feels great*.

+[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qepdfdu0djyed7v/workflows.zip?dl=0][Download all my workflow from dropbox ]], please contact [[https://github.com/yqrashawn][me]] when this link broken.+
I may update this post for each specific config if I have time in the future (may
not happen). If you have any problems or ideas, please [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/issues/new][open an issue]] in my dotfile
repo. And you can also check [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications][KE-complex_modifications]] official repo for more rules
and discussion.

Update: The old download link is broken and I don't have time to maintain all
these workflows up to date. Now that the core thing here is to use alfred
workflow's external trigger feature, I create a [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/alfred-launcher-workflow][app launcher workflow]] as a sample.
