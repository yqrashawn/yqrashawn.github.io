Discussed a lot with my colleague today, mainly about problems we are facing and
problems our company are facing. There one specific problem caused the majority
of other problems. That's why our friends don't have time to learn new things,
or why they won't spend time on improving their skill and knowledge while they
do feel they need to.

In a word, they lack something to invoke their interests for the entry of the
adventure to more unknown.

For me, I subscribe blogs using RSS. Those blogs are found through my daily
question solving or discussing with other developers in open source communities.
So I'm totally into these articles, and they bring me new things every week, new
things that I don't know that don't know. That's the most important thing that
one needs when is buried in daily routine.

So maybe a company knowledge database can solve this problem. A database that
everyone can contribute to and everyone can vote for his/her favorites.
Thus, I write this down so that I may build one for my company.
