Just finish the Halt and Catch Fire, really great show. It makes me think about
that everyone is full of story in their life, amazing to others but definitely
not to themselves, like Joe in the series.

It's just that I think Joe is "right" in some way. The right is some kind of
his every decision of fresh start, it's so decisive. It makes the character
fear nothing. He desires success so much but go through his failer and go for
the fresh start so quick. But on the other hand, he is so emotional, about
his failer, about Gordon's die.

These characters normally can't be on the same person. Maybe that's why it makes
me think Joe is "right".
