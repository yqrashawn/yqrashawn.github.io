I used to use vim with tmux in a terminal emulator. After changing to emacs. It
didn't take much time for me to realize that emacs in GUI works better.

The problem is I still want the old behavior. I tried about three times using
my zsh shell in emacs. I'm not here telling those failed attempts. I want to
write it down because of a recent discovery.

When I restructure my zsh configurations, I find the z-shell works fine with
with zero config. That's when I finally discover that it's the plugins and
configurations that make zsh and emacs incompatible. What's more, I find these
lines. They must come from some emacs package's readme instruction. The original
one is telling zsh don't do something when it's in emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
if [ -n "$INSIDE_EMACS" ]; then
    ...
  else
    ...
fi
#+END_SRC

So I thought, I can just use these line with my zsh configuration([[https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto][prezto]]). It
works fine now after some little test. It turns out the default
[[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions][zsh-autocompletion]] is not playing well with emacs. I use the ~if...else~ code
telling zsh don't load autosugestion while in emacs. And everything is fine now.

That's it. Maybe I'll dig in for getting autocompletion back in emacs someday.
