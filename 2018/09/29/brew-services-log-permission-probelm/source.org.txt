Recently I'm developing this [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo][GokuRakuJoudo]] tool to enable user config [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/][karabiner]]
with [[https://github.com/edn-format/edn][edn]] file instead of json file.

I deploy it to the macOS package manager homebrew so that user can install it
with homebrew easily. Since the tool is used to watch the edn file and transform
it to json file. It's naturally to use homebrew services to run the command.

Homebrew services uses macOS's launchctl tool to read plist file and run
service. The problem is launchctl create the log directory I set in the plist
file with system permission, and the program don't need to run under system
permission. So the service failed.

I tried to find ways to create the directory in the brew formula file. But it
seems one can't get the HOME env variable in the ~def install~ section of the
formula. So that I can't create the ~~/Library/Logs/goku~ folder with user
ownership. I checked other packages like redis and mongodb. But they all need to
run with ~sudo brew services start~.

When I was about to give up and tell user to create the folder themselves before
install the package. I saw there're many other .log files under ~~/Library/Logs~
directory. Then I changed the log file location from ~...Logs/goku/output.log~
to ~.../Logs/goku.log~. It works! User do have write permission to file
~goku.log~. It seems that launchctl only create folders with system owner group
instead of files. Wired problem. Hope this may help people encountered with the
same problem.
