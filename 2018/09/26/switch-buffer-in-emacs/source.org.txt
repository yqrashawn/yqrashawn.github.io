Recently there's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9hmh8n/whats_your_preferred_method_of_switching_buffers/][new post]] on r/emacs discussing about swithcing buffer in
emacs. As I posted before, I have that kind of problem as well. It's just most
of us use ~ibuffer~, ~helm~ or ~ivy~ and we use them for a long time. Yet we
still interest in these discussions. Cause maybe all of us want it to be faster
or more convenient.

For me, I use ~counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer~ and ~ivy-switch-buffer~ to
switch buffer in current project or global. And I have two functions to switch
between the two and three most recent buffer.

It works well if I'm the only one working on this project, which means I name
all the files and directries. But if you have this huge react project and
there's a component directory with more than twenty components with their own
directory and all of their entry files are named ~index.jsx~. Your fingers will
have a hard time.

There's no good solution for, you know, a bad decision. You can only fix it, not
solve it. You can set some project local variables and functions to swtich to
these ~index.jsx~ depends on names of their directories. Or you can get by with
it. Either way takes time and won't make it much better in next project.

Anyway, our emacser will always overcome these kind of things.

I want to share a new package I found yesterday about swtiching buffer in emacs.
And the post end up in complain. My bad.

The package is [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/awesome-tab][awesome-tab]]. And yes it's based on tabbar. In summary, as the
readme says it's a package providing out of box configuration to use tab in
emacs. It group tabs by project and hide unwanted buffers by default. The pros
is you know clearly which buffer you are switching to (assumming you aren't
working on a project like the above one) and you can click on it to switch
buffer. It doesn't have functions like switch to nth tab. So I suppose user
still need to use fuzzy search to switch buffer if there's a lot buffer in a
single project.

I'll try it for several days and see if I'll keep it.
