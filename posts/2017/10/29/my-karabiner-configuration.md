# My Karabiner Elements Configuration

UPDATE 2018-09-19 Wed

My config in [KE-complex-modifications][1] is outdated. I'm now using [GokuRakuJoudo][2] to config karabiner. It enables user to write the configuration in a much more compact karabiner.edn file, you can check out [mine][3]. I'll write a post about it soon. If your karabiner.json is bloated, you may want to try it. Recommend to check the [tutorial][4] first.

ORIGINAL

This post are descriptions and tutorial of my [personal KE complex modification][5].

I [merged][6] my personal [Karabiner Elements][7] configuration into the [official repo][8] several days ago. You can import my personal rules [here][9]. To achieve efficiency, I use karabiner with [Alfred][10] mainly through [alfred workflow external trigger][11] and [osascript][12] (command line tool for calling AppleScript code).

Here are these configurations. Please note that I update my configurations every day. So I can't keep this post up to date. The key here is to introduce a system for launching apps, invoking scripts and all stuffs that can be done with shell (everything). When you can get anything you want with few key strokes, **it feels great**.

<del>[Download all my workflow from dropboxÂ ][13], please contact [me][14] when this link broken.</del> I may update this post for each specific config if I have time in the future (may not happen). If you have any problems or ideas, please [open an issue][15] in my dotfile repo. And you can also check [KE-complex<sub>modifications</sub>][16] official repo for more rules and discussion.

Update: The old download link is broken and I don't have time to maintain all these workflows up to date. Now that the core thing here is to use alfred workflow's external trigger feature, I create a [app launcher workflow][17] as a sample.
