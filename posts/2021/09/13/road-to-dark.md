# My road to dark mode

There's a [reddit drunk post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/) I read months ago talking about a lot about programming life and many things. There's one thing I want to talk about.

> Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.

This was so true to me. I used to use dark mode everywhere until I find there are so many webpages that are so bright that it literally hearts my eye with my dark mode monitor brightness. I then turn back to light mode.

My browser has [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader#readme) installed many years ago. I don't use it a lot until recently. I revisited it and found it supports shortcut to toggle the current webpage between dark and light mode. I [rebind it to a convenient key](https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/blob/63eb1b2850266f494baa72cd01e9b8e3b13dada7/.config/karabiner.edn#L373) and everything just works in browser.

I rebind shortcuts all the time. Why the hell I haven't done it earlier!

What's more, there's a [PR](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/pull/2517) for Dark Reader that make its URL matching system more powerful so that it can handle sites with partial dark mode support, like [Github main site](https://github.com/) and [Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/).

You can fork the repo, merge the PR yourself and build a local version right now if you can't wait.
