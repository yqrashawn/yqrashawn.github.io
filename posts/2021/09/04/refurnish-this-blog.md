# Refurnish this blog

It’s been a long time till last blog (2019). Lot of things happened.
Anyway, I’m here trying to write more.

I moved the blog from lazyblog on GitHub pages to blot.im, since I’m too lazy to use lazyblog and blot.im allow me to be lazier.

Lazyblog is great expect user needs to customized their emacs org-mode config when referring external assets like images. And I’m lazy, then forget about the detail of the customization, removed it when refurnish my emacs config, too lazy to look up it again.

Blot.im is more casual as long as I don’t customize it too much. And since it’s more suited to the lazier me, hope I’ll write more.
