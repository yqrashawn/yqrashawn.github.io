After writing about [[http://yqrashawn.com/2018/09/26/switch-buffer-in-emacs/][switching buffers in emacs]] last year. I keep looking for the
way to switch buffer quicker and more comfortably. I mentioned the package
[[https://github.com/manateelazycat/awesome-tab][awesome-tab]] in that post and I'm still using it.

The package shows buffers as tabs in emacs [[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Header-Lines.html][header line]], and provides functions
to switch to next/prev, first/last tab. It also groups buffers depends on
project and major-mode.

I write a patch for the package to add function to jump to specifc tab recently.
So that user can jump to specific tabs with different shortcuts.

I also write a [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/859][patch]] for [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] to customize the company candidate numbers
when ~company-show-numbers~ is set to t.

Now I can use the home row the way I want in emacs. Check the screenshot below.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt use emacs with home row image :align center :width 500
[[tsfile:2019-01-15_emacs-home-row.png][use emacs with home row]]

As you can see in the picture, instead of numbers, there're "asdf" for both tabs
and completion candidates. Next step is to switch/select tabs/candidates with
home row shortcuts.

#+begin_src clojure
{:des "Emacs m/v select company candidates"
 :rules [:emacs-m-mode
         [:a [:!Tx :!T6 :1]]
         [:s [:!Tx :!T6 :2]]
         [:d [:!Tx :!T6 :3]]
         [:f [:!Tx :!T6 :4]]
         [:g [:!Tx :!T6 :5]]
         :emacs-v-mode
         [:h [:!Tx :!T6 :6]]
         [:j [:!Tx :!T6 :7]]
         [:k [:!Tx :!T6 :8]]
         [:l [:!Tx :!T6 :9]]
         [:semicolon [:!Tx :!T6 :0]]]}
#+end_src

Above code uses [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo][goku]] and [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements][karabiner]] to map ~m+asdfg~ and ~v+hjkl;~ to ~C-x C-6
1234567890~. That's ~'m' key down then click 'a'~ to ~C-x C-6 1~ in emacs. Then I
map ~C-x C-6~ + numbers to functions that switch/select tabs/candidates in
emacs.

#+begin_src elisp
;; jump to specific in emacs
(define-key awesome-tab-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-6 1") (lambda () (interactive) (awesome-tab-jump ?a)))
(define-key awesome-tab-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-6 2") (lambda () (interactive) (awesome-tab-jump ?s)))
(define-key awesome-tab-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-6 3") (lambda () (interactive) (awesome-tab-jump ?d)))

;; select specific candidates in company-active-map
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-x C-6 1") (kbd "M-1"))
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-x C-6 2") (kbd "M-2"))
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-x C-6 3") (kbd "M-3"))
#+end_src

We can use magic now!

'ma' switch to first tab. 'mg' select 5th candidates when completing stuff.

You can find above code in my [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/yqdotfiles/blob/master/.config/karabiner.edn][goku config]] and [[https://github.com/yqrashawn/.emacs.d][.emacs.d]].
